Excel_Macro_Loop_Subdirectories_To_Get_Data is a simple VBA macro for Excel to extract data from the all Excel files (with extensions .xlsx) from sub directories of a folder.

The folder in which the subfolders with excel files, is selected with file selection dialog.

The range is predefined and can be changed easily.

This Excel macro is very useful to consolidate data from Excel tables with same formatting.
